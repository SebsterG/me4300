0. Dofs of discontinuous spaces belonging to the cell with key-press event
   should be highlited.
1. Support for 1D (There should be vertical layers of dofs)
2. DofMapPlotter([V, U]) could be useful for sparsity patterns
3. Switch key for in-plot change of ordering scheme (Needs to be synced accross
   processes with event that occured only on one of them)
